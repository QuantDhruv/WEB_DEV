<h1>Welcome to my Web_Dev repository! ðŸš€</h1>

This repo contains all my learning projects, exercises, and notes as I dive deep into web development, following the amazing tutorials and guidance from **CodeWithHarry**.

## About

I started this repository to organize and practice everything I learn while mastering web development â€” from the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to more advanced topics like backend development, APIs, and frameworks.

This journey is inspired by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.codewithharry.com/), whose clear and practical tutorials have made learning web development accessible and fun.
